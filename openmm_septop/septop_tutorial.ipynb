    "The first step is to create a `LigandNetwork`. Here, we will be using the same process as in the relative hybrid topology `Protocol`, including the use of a mapper which is required by the scorer. **The mappings will not be used in the `Protocol`.** This is a temporary solution until we have developed a scorer specifically for the `SepTopProtocol`. Alternatively, the user can also manually define the edges they want to run when creating the transformations below, without creating a `LigandNetwork` first.\n",

    "2. **Scorer**: Given an atom mapping, provides an estimate of the quality of that mapping (higher scores are better). We will use `default_lomap_scorer`.\n",
