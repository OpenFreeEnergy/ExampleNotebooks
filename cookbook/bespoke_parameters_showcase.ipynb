    "Here we will assume you have succesfully planned your RBFE campaign using OpenFE by following the [showcase](http://try.openfree.energy/) or [RBFE tutorial](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/tutorials/rbfe_cli_tutorial.html#rbfe-cli-tutorial) and will be using the `TYK2` test system in this example with the planned network provided for you at `assests/ligand_network.graphml`. You should have also already generated a set of bespoke parameters for your ligand series following the [BespokeFit production guide](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/bespokefit/en/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#production-fits) and combined the parameters into a single SMIRNOFF style `offxml` file following the gathering [results guide](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/bespokefit/en/latest/users/bespoke-results.html)."
